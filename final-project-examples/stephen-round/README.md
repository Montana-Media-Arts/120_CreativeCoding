Welcome to three dimensions. p5 has a pretty robust 3D engine, and I hope I managed to utilize it well here and show some of its capabilites.

This sketch is the next generation of my swords sketch from the sixth week. It uses a lot of the same structure as the original, but has quite a bit of new flare.

Overall, it's very fun to look at, and I might mess around with it in the future.
